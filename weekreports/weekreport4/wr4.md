## Basic Terminology
* **File system-** the way files are stored and organized.
* **Current directory-** the directory where you are currently at.
* **Parent directory-** a subdirectory or previous directory. Where you are working inside.
* **The difference between your home directory and the home directory-** your home directory is your current working directory. The home directory is the starting folder.
* **Pathname-** indicates the location of a file in the file system.
* **Relative path-** the location of a file starting from the current working directory or a directory that is located inside the current working directory.
* **Absolute path-** the location of a file starting at the root of a file system.
